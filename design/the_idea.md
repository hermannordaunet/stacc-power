# The idea:

As mentioned, many people do not keep an eye on their electricity bills and subscriptions. How can we design something that can make people more informed?

## The dashboard/overview:

To inform people better, we need to present data about their consumption and electricity bill in a clear and easy-to-understand way. When I look at my electricity bill, I often just focus on the consumption and price. How can we present this information in a more engaging and user-friendly way? My idea is to make customers more interested in saving money by providing a live comparison between different energy providers using their data.

At the top of the dashboard, there are four cards: one for the amount of energy used in a predefined time range, one with the price of that usage with your current provider, a card with the average price per kWh, and the last card with possible savings if you switched to the cheapest provider based on the data we have from your consumption.

Some people are simple and do not care about the details of the data we present them, but others are more interested. Because of the different levels of users, we can add a graph to present more data to those who are interested.

At the bottom, we have a comparison between the user's current provider and a chosen provider. This part of the dashboard can help users compare different providers and see what the price would be based on their consumption.

All of these numbers and cards need to be tailored to each individual user, since not everyone has the same consumption at the same time some models fits better for some users than others. To achieve this, we can use data from their consumption to present possible savings if they choose another provider with a different pricing model.

## Moving on to the companies section:

In this view, I want to present different energy providers in an easy-to-understand way. This can be achieved by presenting their prices, pricing model, and a pricing "score" categorized as high, normal, or low. This way, users can see their options and a score based on their consumption. The score will be tailored to each user and will not be the same for everyone.

The reason being that from the data we have on the user and the different pricing models we can give the user a better understanding of what pricing model fits their lifestyle and consumption. 

## Moving on to the third and final view: Energy-saving tips.

This view is intended to help, guide, and encourage users to save more energy and keep their electricity bills down in a fun way. This could be presented as tasks or cards with different tips.
